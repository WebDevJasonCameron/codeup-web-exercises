# Intro To Front End

## 2022 02 02 | Review
Review JS Functions Ex.  Worked on a peer review of function questions.  Refactored the functions Ex files.  Learning more about DOM access through online research

## 2022 02 01 | Functions
We have notes!  These are now in my Notion DB along with the Titan Slack channel.  First, intro to the day had us listing instructions to create a PBJ. Our team's instructions are placed in the notion notes.  I am still trying to figure out how to grab DOM stuff.  Finally, we completed a mini ex with functions.  I placed this in sandbox_02 for now.  The code is also in the notion notes

### 1500 | File Restructure
We are working through a lot of extra Ex on functions.  This code was moved from the sandbox files.  I am noticing that I have a lot of mistakes in my code when I run through it the first time.  When I come back to it later, it is a lot fresher to my eyes.  That is when I can refactor the code, making a better quality product.  Need to do this often.

## 2022 01 31 | In Class
First day to work in class physically.  As such, we are review the "Working with Data Types, Operators and Variables." Found out a better way of completing the fourth Ex.  Specifically, to check for empty spaces at the beginning and end of a variable could be ``` variable.includes(" ");```.  Also, it is a good practice to trim a user's input so there aren't any spaces at in their inputs.

### 1100 | JS Object 2
Hurray!  Figured out what the instructions were tyring to ask us to do.  At the beginning I wasn't able to think correctly.  After some time, I figured out the structure of the JS file.  It was an object with one parameter and two functions.  One of the functions needed to call the other, so it could manipulate the results if the user highlighted that it should.  

### 1500 | Review
Lesson learned: JS inputs are always taken in as a string.  We can force the input into a string by using ```Number(prompt("give me a number);``` or ```parseInt(prompt("give me a number);```.  I don't really know the difference.  

### 1700 | Update Work
I didn't know what the final assignment (#3) was asking for.  It was a review of what we were doing so far.

## 2022 01 30 | JS Objects 1
Completed the Ls and Ex in Objects.  This section focused on how JS doesn't use "classes."  Rather, it uses objects which pretty much do the same thing.  I also remember reading that JS actually does use classes (even if that might be recently added).  None-the-less, this was a very interesting topic.  The Ex instructions were a little confusing.  I did the bonus, but I think I would like to practice more with creating, manipulating and reporting objects.  I created a sandbox folder just so I can do just that. 

### 2020 | Not as Far
I'm going to say it... I didn't get as far as I wanted this weekend.  I absolutely didn't understand the Obj2 Ex instructions.  I understood the Ls, but the Ex didn't make much since to me.  I'll need to listen to the instructor when he explains it later.  Therefore, I have the files in this repo while also marking the area in my notes for clarification.  I also started the BOM Ls and Ex.  The Ls examples are confusing.  It looks like the act of creating variables is forcing the functions to work... but that really doesn't make sense to me.  I need to listen to the instructor during this portion of the class as well.

## 2022 01 29 | JS Loops
Completed the Ex in Loops.  This included While, Do While, For i, Breaks and Continue.  The final Ex was a fun Do While loop to conclude if all the ice cream cones were sold (or if you could sell them based on the order number).  Each Ex required their own JS file.  These are in the js folder.  I tied them all into the loops.html and commented-out the link so there weren't a mess of console logs.  
Possible Issue:  I kept going past the zero trigger used to stop the do while loop in the last Ex.  This could cause some problems in other projects.  I need to figure out how to stop the loop prior to it actually going past zero.    

### 2100 | JS Arrays
Completed the first Ls and Ex on arrays.  This required adding another HTML and JS file to the repo.  The For Each loop is a new tool that I wasn't completely aware of.  I need to practice with it.  It would be good to ask the instructor when we have some time on the subject. 

### 2330 | JS Arrays 2nd
Completed the second Ls and Ex on arrays (need to go to bed!).  This ended with a nice bonus problem where we needed to run the ".map" method on each item within the array.  This gave me the ability to add an open and closing list item HTML tags on each item within the array.  At first, I thought I could do this with a For Each loop.  While this didn't work, I did notice that the For Each and .Map syntax is nearly the same.  Finally, I was able to unshift and push the final unordered list tags to the front and end of the array.  Afterwards, I converted the array into a string using the .join method (with empty string as the argument).

## 2022 01 28 | JS Conditionals
Today, our classroom has a "day off." This was good since I needed to do some "family-life-maintenance."  Still, I was able to complete the JS conditionals lesson and exercise.  There is an "Introduction to Unit Tests" lesson and exercise that I will be starting as well.  However, this will probably take a couple of days to complete since I've not done anything in this subject (unlike most of the intro JS stuff).

## 2022 01 27 | JS Intro
Today we studied the basics of JS.  Although the class wasn't able to get to function, I worked a little ahead and completed the reading and ex. We have a three-day weekend so my plan is to mover through a few more lessons.  However, I will also be working on a couple of udemy courses that will limit my progress in the curriculum.  Lessons are recorded in my Notion notes.  Terms are recorded in a quizlet DB for future study.

## 2022 01 26 | Learning Git 
Notes on today's lessons can be found at: https://onemorejason.notion.site/CodeUp-Intro-To-Front-End-754e210510454cd1b858bf5f535a3752  ... We reviewed some things on .ssh keys, git commands, and how to access GH.  Note, we should have ED25519 ssh keys.  If you want to see what keys you have, you need to type: ls -a ~/.ssh  ... We are also going over a few HTML things.

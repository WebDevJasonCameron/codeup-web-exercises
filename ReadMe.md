# Intro To Front End

##2022 02 27 | Sunday
Reviewing the LinkedIn Learning course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/bootstrap-5-essential-training . There is a wonderful slide (notes) website that I can continue to return to for help in Bootstrap: www.raybo.org/slides_bootstrap5

## 2022 02 26 | Bootstrap Grid
Completed the first assignment.  I made it more difficult that it was at first.  Then I realized the overall page only needed one row with two columns.


---

## 2022 02 25 | Day Off
We have the 'day off' this Friday.  While this means I have the opportunity to work on some family project, I found some time to re-attack the bootstrap Ex.  I found this Ex both frustrating and rewarding.  I can see that bootstrap can provide some significant benefits to programmers.  However, it has also been a challenge for someone who likes more control with their web applications.  In truth, I can see you have the same amount of control with bootstrap as if you created all the CSS styles yourself.  To accomplish this, you need to understand how the third party CSS style interactions affect your work.  So, while it introduces additional complications to the dev process, it can expedite mundane styling standards that multiple devs can expect to work with (a common language so-to-speak).  Therefore, I have completed 75% of the initial Ex within the lesson plan.  Next, I need to introduce tab pages.   

### 2100 | 1st Bootstrap Ex
Completed the Pizza World Bootstrap Ex.  Here are some of the LL I attained from the Ex: One, you can (and should) use script inside the element tag to manipulate things that are not standard.  Two, bootstrap is not a streamlined template.  If a div needs a padding added to it several times, you will need to ensure the class attribute has that one statement inside it (thus the HTML code can become extremely bloated).  Three, the templating system is important for companies that might need to replace programmers (as the turn-over can be great in the industry). Four, getting something to look exactly the way you want it to look can be frustrating with the template system. However, when you have built the component, it can be replicated with ease.  Note: this will still require some time for newer programmers to figure out how the component is constructed.


---

## 2022 02 24 | Morning
Always start early in the class with updates and standard preparations.  This morning is no different.  My focus will be in inspecting the LS and Ex planned for the day.  I have not worked with Bootstrap.  Part of me feels like it is a cheat that employers might think is inferior to what we could do with 'fresh' code.  However, I think I can understand why we might want to use the tech stack.  (There is a Blog article in that: "What exactly is a 'tech stack'").  If we want to focus on building backend applications, using a front end template might be a better use of our time.  

### 930 | Warmup
Working slow this morning.  Didn't have enough time to complete the larger challenge.  Still, I feel like I could have if I was given just a little more time.  LL in this Ex:  One, you can check if a letter is less than or greater to another letter.  Second, you can loop through a string without having to make it an array.

### 1030 | Bootstrap Ls
Working through the Bootstrap Ls.  Side NOTE: I asked whether we would ever be put is a position to only have the capability to change CSS and not the HTML.  It turns out that this might be the normal flow for companies.  HTML might be approved by legal and HR departments, and we might be on teams that can only change the "look" and "feel" of a web page.  I also asked if Bootstrap is a skill set that employers are wanting.  While Bootstrap is not exactly what other companies will use... it does show that you can take existing tools (which companies will often have their own) and use them to create the products required for their customers.  


---

## 2022 02 23 | Pre School
Woke up thinking I could figure out the problem of my burger menu.  Only made the problem worse.  I am in new territory here... It is both awesome and frustrating in equal measures.

### 0915 | Pair Programming Intro
Working in team two.  My team consists of Jose Mendoza and I.  Jose is virtual.  Agile in practice: Pair Programing youtuber video was used to show how to complete the day's assignment.  

### 1530 | Competed Pari Programming Intro
The Ex was Media Queries.  By doing this a second time with the focus on mobile prior to desktop, I found the code to change quite a lot.  The CSS could be better if we were able to structure the HTML in a way that made sense.  Still, the Ex did challenge me to use both flex and float.  I can imagine that much of what was done could have been better executed if we were also to use grid.  I place a lot of comments and notes within the CSS to remember some very important LL.   

---

## 2022 02 22 | Warm UP
Completed a function that created an object with the data found in two different arrays.  LL, you can push an obj to an array of obj without needing to name that obj.  Also, if you have your obj outside the for loop (or loops in general), that obj will not be 'refreshed' if you are trying to push it to an array (as it combines data from the other arrays). NOTE: Question... What do you use flex box?  Answer... One dimensional layouts of a components.  

### 1530 | More work in CSS Bonus
See the CSS B repo

### 2200 | Long Day, Dif Repo
It has been a long day in the CSS B repo.  While I'm at the 97% completion (estimated), it is always the last three percent that caused the headaches.  Why doesn't something meet the exact pixel dimensions?  How do I check for attributes and push changes on those elements that should change under certain circumstances.  These are just a few questions I try to figure out.  Later...


--- 

## 2022 02 21 | Reformat Readme
I do not have a lot of time for study.  It is President's Day and I need to spend time with family.  However, I noticed this readme file had mistakes in the time hashtags' markdown structures.  I corrected that.  I am also using what time I do have to work on the CSS Bonus Repo.  Check that readme for further information.

### 1130 | Coming Soon Proj Completed
Completed the first CSS Bonus challenge called "Coming Soon."  All my LL are found in the CSS Bonus Repo's ReadMe file.  I will set up the next project prior to leaving for the day. 

### 2230 | 2nd Challenger Work
I have a scaffold of the second challenge has been completed.  I need to work on some details, JS for the quotes, and button transformations.  (...Ok... this is a comment because nothing is updating in the GH)

---

## 2022 02 20 | MQ Frustrations
I am working on the media quires Ex.  It is really frustrating.  The concept of changing the type of style according to the size of screen (or type of media) is not.  However, I need to structure a page according to the HTML that is given to me.  That is something that I find very hard to do!  The specific task is to use the CSS tips and tricks to make a page look as it does in a jpg.  However, It fails to provide the upfront structure (building blocks) that would make the task sensible!  While I do expect it can provide instructional insight to additional ways to use CSS, it is also so very aggravating to be given a rubik's cube and told to figure it out... WITHOUT pulling the stickers off!  I like building things... riddles (while similar) are not the same. Riddles expect you to provide a specific answer.  Building complex things expects that a product will be produced regardless of the how.  

### 2200 | Completed?
I think I completed most of the Ex.  However, I will be paying close attention on how the instructor does this Ex.  There are a lot of things that I feel like I could have done a much better job on.

---

## 2022 02 18 | Morning work
Completed the third assignment in the "practice flexbox" Ex.  We were asked to create a footer using flexbox properties and a set of instructions.  It's not the prettiest footer, but it was completed prior to class.  I think we will be discussing the positioning of items in CSS.

### 1330 | Flexbox
We did a lot in the flexbox Ls.  Brain is fuzzy.  It is a lot like thinking spatially.

### 1530 | Cont Flexbox
This Ex is challenging.  Completed this prior to the class.  My challenge is to create the same thing without prior code.  I need to check the previous code, so I can get the same color and sizes.  This also helps solidify some words I hadn't recognized.  One of those things is the ```:nth-of-type(#)```.  I was aware of the child and parent hooks.  This lets me have several "sections" without the need to give them a class or ID!  

### 0007 | Pat Due
I Know I should push anything after midnight.  However, I completed the 'warm up JS challenge' that was given to us at the end of the day (Friday).  I organized the final code into several screenshots.  They were sent to Discord. with the hope that others might see their own way to complete the Ex.  Despite that, I feel the code could be refactored to something more refined.  I, however, am not known to be very refined!  Capt Smash for a good reason.  


---

## 2022 02 17 | CSS
Completed warm up.  I should probably check to see if it can be mod.  Class is discussing Box Modelling for CSS.  I completed the Flexbox Ex.  It was really difficult.  Apparently, you cannot ```justify-self``` they way I would expect you to be able to do.  Instead, ```flex-grow``` helped finish aligning the ```h3``` header text the way I needed it to be done.  
Additionally: I worked on SB05.  I added the form elements to help change the page.  This should let me test the filter without needing to type in different critieria.  It really looks like it is nearly complete (without glossy work).  

### 1430 | CSS Bonus
We have bonus material for CSS.  This can be found in an additional repo.  I will set up a readme.md file in that repo to discus what I've learned.  Unfortunately, I'll need to wait until I've completed the assignments in this part of the lesson plan.  Afterwards, I'll take on this sweet challenge (^^).

### 1630 | CSS Flexbox Practice Ex
I 'completed' two of the three flexbox practice ex.  I do not know if they made a difference.  I am definitely going to need to pay attention to the lecture when it comes.

### 2230 | CSS Position Ex
Completed the impromptu Ex on positioning elements within CSS.  I really feel like there should be a straight forward understanding how the structured language should work.  It makes very little since.  Much is guess work, trial and error, and luck.  Still, it is something that rewards experimentation.  I learned that you can make a box (element) fixed.  Afterwards, you can make lower elements absolute (or relative) to that element.  There is no need for making the ```position: absolute``` and ```position: relative``` at the same time!  


--- 

## 2022 02 16 | Intro to CSS
Starting the CSS Intro in class.  Also, working on the SB05.  Fixing the filter.  I need to set up a check flag feature that will help me keep from adding additional cards that I did not want.  [UPDATE] As it goes, I both fixed and broke the main filter.  Everything will filter as long we select a type.  However, if I select size, align, or legend, it all breaks (>.<).  I will continue working on this after class.

### 1140 | CSS Float
Started the CSS Floats and Positioning Ls and Ex.  This one is hard.  I think it is harder because we need to work with the code that is supplied.  This is a lot different because you need to read someone else's code and make decisions based on someone else's organization.  This is great (hard, but great) because we will be working with others.  It is a challenge I highly appreciate.  

### 1330 | CSS F&P Ex
Completed the CSS F&P Ex.  This was challenging.  This is partially because I had problems understanding what was being asked in the instructions.  I might have also worked the code to fit the way I understand how CSS float works.  I was able to include absolute and relative portioning.  We also used the ```calc(percentage - pixels)``` to ensure the floats would work.  Best practice for this (I think) is to through a color in the background.  When you see actual box that is being manipulated, you can open up inspect window and select the element.  Inside the CSS (Style) window, you can increase/decrease the number of pixels to see what should fit the best.  

### 2150 | CSS FB Ex
Alright, this Ex is really hard.  This Ex requires completing a series of CSS FB requirements.  It is unlike any website you wat to have.  However, it looks like a blueprint of a website construction.  It also works like riddle. 


---

## 2022 02 15 | Form and CSS
Completed the Forms Ex, second part.  Also completed the Forms Ls.  Some things to remember: need to have a name in the input element. It can be sent out only if it has a name.  I also went through the CSS Ls and added terms to the study flash cards (quizlet).  Afterwards, I completed the first part of the CSS Ex.

### 1430 | Forms and CSS cont
The class is continuing with the form Ex.  Learned that keeping labels tied to radio and checkbox input elements gives people with difficulty selecting small areas on their screen a wider hit area.  

### 2215 | Fixed Login
Fixed the login CSS Ex.  It was a little difficult.  Using the ```calc(100% - 5px)``` allowed me to reduce the size by 5 px.  This accounts for the two pixel border.  Two on one side and two on the other.  At total of four... but somehow five makes it look just right.

---

## 2022 02 14 | Obj Ex
First, we completed a warmup ex.  To recap, this called for an obj to be created.  Then, we were asked to create a function that gives an either/or response based on what the obj data.  I got it to work with caveats.  I used the ```.this``` key word with a function outside th obj.  However, this breaks when I tried to use the ```argument.objElement```.  I really don't know as to why at the moment. !!! FIXED !!!

Second, we walked through the Obj Ex during the morning.  I had not completed problem 3 (failed to read the whole problem).  That can be a running theme in my work.  As such, I completed the problem by creating an obj array, a function that gives me a statement based on a criteria, and then forEach function to loop through the obj array.  

Third, I also worked on SB05.  First I decided to clean up the JS format.  Second, I added more CSS.  Third, I update the HTML bullet points.

### 1550 | HTML
Working through the intro to HTML Ls.  Completed both parts of Ex.  However, I am not sure if the second part was done correctly.  It sounds like they want to use a table.  I used div tags inside a main element.  The look is correct.  The semantics are not the same. 

### 1700 | HTML Forms
I started working on the forms Ls and Ex.  I will need to place a lot of info in the card deck for future study.  The words seem simple, but I think I could do a pretty good job at still getting them confused.  There is a lot to forms that should help in work.  It might be dry and a little unintuitive, but it is critical to fully grasp its implementation.  


---

## 2022 02 13 | Sort Array of OBJ
Small victories.  Today I was able to check that I could manipulate the CSS of the data being placed in the web page with JS.  I also found out how to sort an array of objects by selecting a specific element.  As such, I can include more objects in the array and then call the sort function to ensure they all stay alphabetized.  Interestingly, this is not as obvious to do as simply sorting an array of elements.  It can be even more complicated when you're trying to sort strings from an object's attributes.  For example, I'm building an array of "monster cards" that have the name of the monster (along with several attributes).  To sort the array, I need to:
```javascript
    function sortMonsterList(){
        monstersList.sort(function(a, b){
            if(a.mName.toLowerCase() < b.mName.toLowerCase()) return -1;
            if(a.mName.toLowerCase() > b.mName.toLowerCase()) return 1;
            return 0;
        });
    }

```

---

## 2022 02 12 | Sandbox 5
Reworking much of the work done in Sandbox 3.  This time I'm wanting to use objects of monster data.  This should help me create cards that can be filtered by the additional categories. It also gives me the ability to practice creating a better connection to the HTML doc.   


---

## 2022 02 11 | Warm Up
We did a JS array warm up called remove b's. The lesson I learned from this is that when you are manipulating the array with ```replace()```, ```toLowercase()```, and other functions... this MUST be put in an Output Array, so it can be returned.  Otherwise, nothing will change.  Also, if you get an undefined when you are trying to CL a function's return make sure you are actually returning something out of the function!

### 1400 | Note on Obj
I have been trying to create an empty array that would store objects later... Of course, that is what we were doing in our Ex.  I just hadn't realized that this was exactly what I was attempting to do.  LL.  

### 1600 | Fibonacci Numbers
Spent a couple of hours on this problem.  I needed to put it aside.  I will tackle it over the weekend. I probably will need to look up some JS help on this. 


---

## 2022 02 10 | Assessment Morning
Starting the day with assessment prep and test. Completed test (all green!) and performed a walk through.  Some lessons learned.  Here is what I found out during the assessment... The ```isNaN``` function can help with determining whether a string is a string consisting of numbers.  

```javascript
    return isNaN('1234')            // returns false... is not NaN
```
However, booleans and null get through this validation check.  As such, you must parse the string into an integer.  NOTE: using the ```Number.``` function doesn't work! By parsing the variable within the isNaN function, we ensure that only numbers or strings with numbers are returning false to the isNaN function.  Here is an example:

```javascript
    return isNaN(parseInt(false));  // returns false... is not NaN
    return isNaN(parseInt(true));  // returns false
    return isNaN(parseInt(null));  // returns false

```
I really don't remember the instructors explaining this.  I think it really messed a lot of students up on the exam.  Final thoughts... I need to read the MDN docs.  I cannot trust the instructors to teach everything we will need on the assessments.  Even if we are allowed to Google possible answers, time constraints makes this very difficult if you haven't already familiarize yourself with the different parts of JS.

### 1530 | Test Review Cont
Interestingly, if you figure out the verification factors, you can often reuse them throughout the whole assessment.  Thus, this test could be extremely easy for those you get that actual key.  Again, the TDD based assessments are really a poor substitute to actually following the assignment's instructions.  


---

## 2022 02 09 | Review Arrays
Agenda set.  See Notion notes.  No warmups.  Continued onto walk through of the array Ls and Ex. Deciding to backtrack on the Sandbox 3 practice.  Will remove current text box and create a dropdown input filter to remove some monster types from the list.  After that is complete, I will continue with the auto filter as you type in a type name.  

### 1100 | Zantanna Speech
While learning about arrays, we had a challenge to create a function that reproduces the speech of Zantanna.  This was a lot of fun.  It also caused me to use different built-in JS functions.  I needed to cut up a string, putting words into an array.  Then, each item in the array could be reversed letter-by-letter.  That result needed to be pushed into a new array.  Afterwards, the new array was combined into a new string.  Additional peaces to this challenge included removing commas and uppercase letters.  Lastly, I needed to force the first letter of the first word in the sentence to be uppercase.  There might be some more things I could do this function later.  However, I copied the function into the interview problems director.  The HTML talks about how this should be done.  Finally, I want to continue working on the page, so we could put in a new string and have that pushed back to the browser.  

### 1700 | Practices
Most of the afternoon work is found in the additional repos provided to us.  They were meant to prepare us for tomorrow's assessment.  The were very helpful in seeing things in an assessment point of view.  I also completed the ZS interview project.  Finally, I made some amazing advancements with the Creature Feature project.  

### 2200 | Late Night Practice
Just reviewing code.  Refactor some parts.  Noticed that single if/else blocks might be able to simply be converted into a return true/false conclusion.  Otherwise, each if statement will require an else to get the converse bool.  Other than that, most of the code remained the same.  I did notice that someone used a ```toString``` method that I'm not familiar with in JS.  It cut their code down by several lines.  Also, one test provided instructions that an argument should be treated in a specific manner if it was of a certain data-type.  However, by using the ```Number``` type-set, it made the concern moot.  These assessments really test how well you can beat the test and not how well you can write code to meet the instructional expectations.

---

## 2022 02 08 | Warmups
Warmups focussed on functions and math.  Completed the Loops Ls and Ex.  I worked on Sandbox 3 JS exercise while we worked through the Ex.  All the steps are instructed in the HTML (and comments) portion of the files.  The purpose for the sandbox is to help me figure out how to do the Coffee and Creature Feature project.  I had success in updating the HTML doc with an array of data from the JS file. I am now trying to figure out how to filter some of those items from being displayed on the web page.  Again, this process is found in the page.  

### 1315 | Sandbox 3
I figured out how to hide an element from the web page.  That might not sound crazy hard, but it was making my brain whirl.  The first problem came when I was trying to grab an array from the JS document and set a CSS style attribute to it (after pushing it to the page).  The problem was that it had nothing to do with the web page until I pushed it to the browser.  Instead, I needed to create another array from web page (now holding the li item elements).  So, this array held element tags that could be given CSS style attributes.  Once this was done, I stumbled on two lines of code that should work... yet only one actually did.  
Here is the bad code:
```javascirpt
    monsterTypeHTMLArray[i].setAttribute('class', 'hide');    
```
The following code actually worked:
```javascirpt
    monsterTypeHTMLArray[i].style.display = 'none';
```

### 1330 | Arrays
Working through the lesson and preparing to do the Ex.  Array Ex continues.

### 1530 | Sandbox 3
Still trying to figure out how to auto search array while you're typing 




---

## 2022 02 07 | Warmups
First we started the day completing the TDD.  Learned that things get very odd when we use isNaN.  to complete number 13, I needed to include ```isNaN`` in the logic of the test.  Here are two ways we got the code to work:
```javascript
    it('should return NaN when passed 2 and "apples"', function(){
        expect(add("banana", "split")).toBeNaN();
});
```
It also worked with the following code (however, I'm not sure if this is truely a fix)
```javascript
    it('should return NaN if num1 input is "banana" and num2 input is "split"', function () {
        expect(isNaN(add('banana', 'split')));
});
```
NOTE: I added this to the Journal MD in the actual repo...

### 1100 | Loops
Working on the Class notes and conditional loops.  Completed the While and Do-while.  It is a lot of fun.  Had a small error in the "Ice cream cone" problem.  I added an extra console.log that showed the final total after the loop was a negative number (at times).  

### 1500 | Creature Feature
In preparation to the Coffee project we have coming up, I decided to create a similar project that provides cards of monster information based on the same filtering attributes.  Today, I built the HTML and CSS scaffolding to the project.  This will be used to "pin" JS code.  

### 1700 | Class Conclusions
Continued to work with Creature Feature work.  Built an array of objects.  Trying to figure out how to break each object out into a div tag with a h3 and p tag.  This will be used to build more monster cards within its card container. 

### 2130 | Creature Feature 
I feel so close to the answer on how to add cards to the monster card table.  However, it eludes me.  I will probably need to spend some time in some Udemy courses to complete this.  That and lessons found in YouTube will probably help.  Still, one victory is getting the entire string to show HTML tags with the monster obj information.  This has NOT been a waste.  It only means that (although I made what feels a major achievement) I still must take my time in progressing through these things.

### 2230 | FizzBuzz
I asked during class if the instructors had exercises that we could practice on that would prepare us for technical interviews.  I admit that I was surprised that I was told that I should do a FizzBuzz exercise.  I remember doing something like this in an online Udemy Python course.  I decided to do the project to see how things might be different in JS.  I found that the exercise only took a few minutest.  The reason for this isn't because I am great at coding... rather I have seen the trick behind how this problem needs to be solved.  JS is very much like Python in its "simplicity" or "flexibility" (to a point).  I was surprised to read that this really is an interview question.  I think it would be a great opportunity to break this problem down in a blog at some point.  The purpose is to identify why it actually continues to be a classical interview problem that still trips-up job-seeking programmers.  


---

## 2022 02 04 | JS Assessment 
Completed first JS assessment.  Completed seven out of ten.  Most relied on using the ```typeOf``` function.  Things to remember:  1) green often matters more than the test being correct, 2) go for the web as soon as you can't remmeber something specific (practice this by asking yourself questions and looking for the answers), 3) plug in those answers to see if they even work, 4) try using ternary statements if it is one or another answer, 5) don't overcomplicate the problem, 6) the provided test code does NOT match with what the test code is checking (don't waist time console.log those examples), 7) after completing the first question, set up the git add and commit commands.  Every five questions should be committed with a comment explaining where you are in the test.  If there are any other thoughts I will write them down in this readme uncer the title "Assessment Thoughts."

### 2230 | TDD
When I think I understand JS keeps pulling some really weird behaviors.  I think I get TDD.  It might be important.  However, right now it seems really tedious.  It would be nice to have some high level view of how this process can really save your code production time.  At the moment, it looks like it's only good if you want to make a coding school that auto grades students on their progress of coding.  The most glaring part about this process is that a flawed test can be devastating to both checking code and teaching code.  During our assessment, I found several problems.  In some scenarios, I could build code that "greened" the test questions while completely failing to meet the assigned objectives.  There has to be a better way.  


---

## 2022 02 03 | Conditionals JS
Reviewing Conditionals Ex within the class.  I'm working with the DOM Ls2 and Ex2. || Completed 2nd DOM Ls and Ex.  Adding more buttons to practice removing changes from the change buttons.  Not completed yet.

### 1330 | Conditional Walk-through
Some research showed me that the ```.removeEventListener()``` is not good for removing the changes we performed during our Ex.  It does work for something that is ongoing, like an alert.  If I want to make toggling changes, I would need to use conditional statements (such as if/else).

### 1700 | 
THIS is why I wanted to go through the coding boot camp!  Best practices like wrapping your JS code with an anonymous function.  By using ```(function(){ // Code here })();``` we can ensure that other browser based variables are not overwritten by our code within.  We concluded with the subject of variable scopes within JS.  I am making mistakes based on what we (college) taught us during Python and Java courses.  I need to remember that there are significant differences between the languages.  Concepts remain the same, but syntax and program interactions do tend to be a lot different.  

---

## 2022 02 02 | Review
Review JS Functions Ex.  Worked on a peer review of function questions.  Refactored the functions Ex files.  Learning more about DOM access through online research.  Made progress.  However, completing one line of code in one file doesn't seem to reproduce the same results in the Ex file.  For one thing, I was able to grab list item tags (using a class) and change their text color using a ForI loop.  In the ex file, I am supposed to grab the li tag and do the same.  It will not work.  I also tried giving them each a class tag and select them with that.  Nothing!  It is a little frustrating not knowing why.  

### 1400 | Conditionals JS
Rereading the Conditionals Ls.  Checking the Ex files as well... 

### 1700 | DOM JS
Completed the first DOM Ex.  During class, we completed the Conditionals Ex along with some extra Ex.  Found out that you must realize that a string length will return 0 which is different from ```""```.  Now that I say this, I realize that it is obvious.  Still, being tired I easily missed this.  I could have simply wrote ```string === ""```. 



---


## 2022 02 01 | Functions JS
We have notes!  These are now in my Notion DB along with the Titan Slack channel.  First, intro to the day had us listing instructions to create a PBJ. Our team's instructions are placed in the notion notes.  I am still trying to figure out how to grab DOM stuff.  Finally, we completed a mini ex with functions.  I placed this in sandbox_02 for now.  The code is also in the notion notes

### 1500 | File Restructure
We are working through a lot of extra Ex on functions.  This code was moved from the sandbox files.  I am noticing that I have a lot of mistakes in my code when I run through it the first time.  When I come back to it later, it is a lot fresher to my eyes.  That is when I can refactor the code, making a better quality product.  Need to do this often.

## 2022 01 31 | In Class
First day to work in class physically.  As such, we are review the "Working with Data Types, Operators and Variables." Found out a better way of completing the fourth Ex.  Specifically, to check for empty spaces at the beginning and end of a variable could be ``` variable.includes(" ");```.  Also, it is a good practice to trim a user's input so there aren't any spaces at in their inputs.

### 1100 | JS Object 2
Hurray!  Figured out what the instructions were tyring to ask us to do.  At the beginning I wasn't able to think correctly.  After some time, I figured out the structure of the JS file.  It was an object with one parameter and two functions.  One of the functions needed to call the other, so it could manipulate the results if the user highlighted that it should.  

### 1500 | Review
Lesson learned: JS inputs are always taken in as a string.  We can force the input into a string by using ```Number(prompt("give me a number);``` or ```parseInt(prompt("give me a number);```.  I don't really know the difference.  

### 1700 | Update Work
I didn't know what the final assignment (#3) was asking for.  It was a review of what we were doing so far.

## 2022 01 30 | JS Objects 1
Completed the Ls and Ex in Objects.  This section focused on how JS doesn't use "classes."  Rather, it uses objects which pretty much do the same thing.  I also remember reading that JS actually does use classes (even if that might be recently added).  None-the-less, this was a very interesting topic.  The Ex instructions were a little confusing.  I did the bonus, but I think I would like to practice more with creating, manipulating and reporting objects.  I created a sandbox folder just so I can do just that. 

### 2020 | Not as Far
I'm going to say it... I didn't get as far as I wanted this weekend.  I absolutely didn't understand the Obj2 Ex instructions.  I understood the Ls, but the Ex didn't make much since to me.  I'll need to listen to the instructor when he explains it later.  Therefore, I have the files in this repo while also marking the area in my notes for clarification.  I also started the BOM Ls and Ex.  The Ls examples are confusing.  It looks like the act of creating variables is forcing the functions to work... but that really doesn't make sense to me.  I need to listen to the instructor during this portion of the class as well.

## 2022 01 29 | JS Loops
Completed the Ex in Loops.  This included While, Do While, For i, Breaks and Continue.  The final Ex was a fun Do While loop to conclude if all the ice cream cones were sold (or if you could sell them based on the order number).  Each Ex required their own JS file.  These are in the js folder.  I tied them all into the loops.html and commented-out the link so there weren't a mess of console logs.  
Possible Issue:  I kept going past the zero trigger used to stop the do while loop in the last Ex.  This could cause some problems in other projects.  I need to figure out how to stop the loop prior to it actually going past zero.    

### 2100 | JS Arrays
Completed the first Ls and Ex on arrays.  This required adding another HTML and JS file to the repo.  The For Each loop is a new tool that I wasn't completely aware of.  I need to practice with it.  It would be good to ask the instructor when we have some time on the subject. 

### 2330 | JS Arrays 2nd
Completed the second Ls and Ex on arrays (need to go to bed!).  This ended with a nice bonus problem where we needed to run the ".map" method on each item within the array.  This gave me the ability to add an open and closing list item HTML tags on each item within the array.  At first, I thought I could do this with a For Each loop.  While this didn't work, I did notice that the For Each and .Map syntax is nearly the same.  Finally, I was able to unshift and push the final unordered list tags to the front and end of the array.  Afterwards, I converted the array into a string using the .join method (with empty string as the argument).

## 2022 01 28 | JS Conditionals
Today, our classroom has a "day off." This was good since I needed to do some "family-life-maintenance."  Still, I was able to complete the JS conditionals lesson and exercise.  There is an "Introduction to Unit Tests" lesson and exercise that I will be starting as well.  However, this will probably take a couple of days to complete since I've not done anything in this subject (unlike most of the intro JS stuff).

## 2022 01 27 | JS Intro
Today we studied the basics of JS.  Although the class wasn't able to get to function, I worked a little ahead and completed the reading and ex. We have a three-day weekend so my plan is to mover through a few more lessons.  However, I will also be working on a couple of udemy courses that will limit my progress in the curriculum.  Lessons are recorded in my Notion notes.  Terms are recorded in a quizlet DB for future study.

## 2022 01 26 | Learning Git 
Notes on today's lessons can be found at: https://onemorejason.notion.site/CodeUp-Intro-To-Front-End-754e210510454cd1b858bf5f535a3752  ... We reviewed some things on .ssh keys, git commands, and how to access GH.  Note, we should have ED25519 ssh keys.  If you want to see what keys you have, you need to type: ls -a ~/.ssh  ... We are also going over a few HTML things.

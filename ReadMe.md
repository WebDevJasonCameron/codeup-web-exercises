# Intro To Front End

## 2022 01 29 | JS Loops
Completed the Ex in Loops.  This included While, Do While, For i, Breaks and Continue.  The final Ex was a fun Do While loop to conclude if all the ice cream cones were sold (or if you could sell them based on the order number).  Each Ex required their own JS file.  These are in the js folder.  I tied them all into the loops.html and commented-out the link so there weren't a mess of console logs.  
Possible Issue:  I kept going past the zero trigger used to stop the do while loop in the last Ex.  This could cause some problems in other projects.  I need to figure out how to stop the loop prior to it actually going past zero.    

### 2100 | JS Arrays
Completed the first Ls and Ex on arrays.  This required adding another HTML and JS file to the repo.  The For Each loop is a new tool that I wasn't completely aware of.  I need to practice with it.  It would be good to ask the instructor when we have some time on the subject. 

### 2330 | JS Arrays 2nd
Completed the second Ls and Ex on arrays (need to go to bed!).  This ended with a nice bonus problem where we needed to run the ".map" method on each item within the array.  This gave me the ability to add an open and closing list item HTML tags on each item within the array.  At first, I thought I could do this with a For Each loop.  While this didn't work, I did notice that the For Each and .Map syntax is nearly the same.  Finally, I was able to unshift and push the final unordered list tags to the front and end of the array.  Afterwards, I converted the array into a string using the .join method (with empty string as the argument).

## 2022 01 28 | JS Conditionals
Today, our classroom has a "day off." This was good since I needed to do some "family-life-maintenance."  Still, I was able to complete the JS conditionals lesson and exercise.  There is an "Introduction to Unit Tests" lesson and exercise that I will be starting as well.  However, this will probably take a couple of days to complete since I've not done anything in this subject (unlike most of the intro JS stuff).

## 2022 01 27 | JS Intro
Today we studied the basics of JS.  Although the class wasn't able to get to function, I worked a little ahead and completed the reading and ex. We have a three-day weekend so my plan is to mover through a few more lessons.  However, I will also be working on a couple of udemy courses that will limit my progress in the curriculum.  Lessons are recorded in my Notion notes.  Terms are recorded in a quizlet DB for future study.

## 2022 01 26 | Learning Git 
Notes on today's lessons can be found at: https://onemorejason.notion.site/CodeUp-Intro-To-Front-End-754e210510454cd1b858bf5f535a3752  ... We reviewed some things on .ssh keys, git commands, and how to access GH.  Note, we should have ED25519 ssh keys.  If you want to see what keys you have, you need to type: ls -a ~/.ssh  ... We are also going over a few HTML things.

# Intro To Front End

## 2022 01 28 | JS Conditionals
Today, our classroom has a "day off." This was good since I needed to do some "family-life-maintenance."  Still, I was able to complete the JS conditionals lesson and exercise.  There is an "Introduction to Unit Tests" lesson and exercise that I will be starting as well.  However, this will probably take a couple of days to complete since I've not done anything in this subject (unlike most of the intro JS stuff).

Today we studied the basics of JS.  Although the class wasn't able to get to function, I worked a little ahead and completed the reading and ex. We have a three-day weekend so my plan is to mover through a few more lessons.  However, I will also be working on a couple of udemy courses that will limit my progress in the curriculum.  Lessons are recorded in my Notion notes.  Terms are recorded in a quizlet DB for future study.

We reviewed some things on .ssh keys, git commands, and how to access GH.  Note, we should have ED25519 ssh keys.  If you want to see what keys you have, you need to type: ls -a ~/.ssh  ... We are also going over a few HTML things.

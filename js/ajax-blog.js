// AJAX BLOG INSTRUCTIONS:
// 1. Create a new html file called ajax-blog.html.
// 2. At minimum, your Ajax blog will need an empty
//    <div> with an id of posts.
// 3. Add your own Bootstrap theme to this file as well.
//    Feel free to use the same one as your store or
//    choose a different one.
// 4. Download blog.json to your data directory from before.
// 5. Use Ajax to load the contents of blog.json and add the
//    data from it to your #posts div.
// 6. Add additional entries to blog.json and make sure your
//    changes are reflected on the page.

$(document).ready(function() {

    $.get('data/blog.json')

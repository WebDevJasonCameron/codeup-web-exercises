    <h1>Zantanna Speech</h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce the way a DC character speaks.  The superhero Zantanna speaks her sentences by reversing the letters of each word in the sentence while keeping them in order.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an example of what she should say:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "I am not saying you cannot be anything you want to be, but the whole superhero thing is much more than just wearing a cape and getting famous"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        However, that quote now becomes:
    </p>
    <blockquote id="zs-example"></blockquote>

    <h2>Lets Try It Ourselves</h2>
    <form action="#">
        <lable>Submit your own string</lable>
        <input type="text" name="zs-tryIt" id="zs-tryIt"><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit!" id="zs-submit"><br>
    </form>

    <blockquote id="zs-user-string"></blockquote>
